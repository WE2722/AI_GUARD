# Technical Documentation

This section provides in-depth technical information about the AI-Guard facial recognition security system. It covers the system architecture, data models, machine learning algorithms, and implementation details.

## Components Overview

AI-Guard is built with a modular architecture consisting of several key components:

### Core Components

- **Face Detection Module**: Locates and extracts faces from video feeds
- **Face Recognition Module**: Identifies individuals by comparing face embeddings
- **Enrollment System**: Captures and processes face data for registration
- **Alert System**: Notifies security personnel of unauthorized access
- **Data Storage**: Manages face embeddings and system data

### Technology Stack

AI-Guard leverages several technologies:

- **Python**: Core programming language for all components
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision operations and camera integration
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for face recognition models
- **MTCNN/Faster R-CNN**: Face detection algorithms
- **FaceNet/ArcFace**: Face recognition models
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Current user interface

## System Design

AI-Guard follows a modular, pipeline-based design:
