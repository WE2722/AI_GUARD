Key Features
-----------

* üé• **Multi-angle Face Enrollment** - Register users with front, left, and right profile captures
* üîç **Real-time Recognition** - Identify individuals from camera feeds
* üîî **Alert System** - Notify security personnel of unauthorized access
* üìä **Security Analytics** - Visualize security data and trends
* üõ°Ô∏è **Access Control** - Manage authorized personnel database
* üß† **Advanced ML Models** - Based on FaceNet, ArcFace, and MTCNN

Project Status
-------------

AI-Guard is currently in **proof-of-concept stage**. This documentation covers both:

* **Current functionality**: What's implemented and available now
* **Planned features**: The complete vision for the system upon full deployment

Quick Start
----------

To get started with AI-Guard:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-guard.git
    cd ai-guard

    # Create virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Run the enrollment script
    jupyter notebook notebooks/NNNNNNNNN1111.ipynb

Check the `Quick Start Guide <getting-started/quick-start.html>`_ for more detailed instructions.

Dataset
-------

AI-Guard uses an extensively processed version of the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset as its foundation. You can download this dataset from Kaggle:

.. code-block:: python

    import kagglehub
    # Download latest version
    path = kagglehub.dataset_download("wiameelhafid/aiguard-split-data")
    print("Path to dataset files:", path)

About the Project
----------------

AI-Guard was developed by `Wiame El Hafid and Houssam Rjili <about/team.html>`_ at ENSAM Mekn√®s to address growing security concerns in educational institutions. The system aims to provide a robust, cost-effective security solution through advanced facial recognition technology.
