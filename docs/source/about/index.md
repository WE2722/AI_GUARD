# About AI-Guard

AI-Guard is an intelligent facial recognition security system designed to enhance security at ENSAM Meknès by preventing unauthorized access to campus facilities.

## Project Overview

AI-Guard uses advanced computer vision and deep learning technologies to monitor entry points, identify individuals, and alert security personnel when unauthorized access is attempted. The system aims to provide a robust, cost-effective security solution that can improve campus safety while efficiently managing resources.

### Key Features

- **Facial Recognition**: Accurately identify authorized individuals using state-of-the-art deep learning models
- **Multi-Angle Capture**: Register faces from multiple angles for improved recognition accuracy
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously monitor entry points and process video streams in real time
- **Automated Alerts**: Notify security personnel when unauthorized individuals are detected
- **Security Analytics**: Track and analyze access patterns and security events

## Project Background

### The Security Challenge

Educational institutions face growing security concerns, including:

- Unauthorized access leading to theft of valuable equipment
- Student and staff safety risks
- Increasing incidents of trespassing in educational facilities
- Valuable resources left unprotected

ENSAM Meknès specifically encountered challenges with:

- Difficulty differentiating between authorized and unauthorized individuals
- Lack of real-time alerting capabilities
- No automated documentation of security events
- Limited security personnel resources

### Our Solution

AI-Guard was developed to address these challenges by providing:

- Real-time monitoring of entry points
- Automated distinction between authorized and unauthorized individuals
- Immediate alert system for security personnel
- Comprehensive security logs and analytics
- Adaptable security configuration based on requirements
- Operation in various lighting conditions
- Multi-face detection capabilities

## Technical Approach

AI-Guard leverages several advanced technologies:

### Machine Learning Models

- **Face Detection**: Using MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) and Faster R-CNN for locating faces in images
- **Face Recognition**: Implementing FaceNet and ArcFace for generating face embeddings and matching identities
- **Custom Dataset**: Fine-tuned on an extensively processed version of the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset

### System Capabilities

The system provides three primary capabilities:

1. **Unauthorized Access Detection**: Identifies unknown individuals at entry points
2. **Security Documentation**: Generates detailed security reports and evidence
3. **Alert System**: Notifies security personnel through various channels

## Current State and Future Vision

AI-Guard is currently in a proof-of-concept stage, with the following components implemented:

- Face detection and recognition models
- Multi-angle face enrollment workflow
- Basic recognition capabilities from images and video

The future vision for AI-Guard includes:

- Web-based administration interface
- Real-time video processing from multiple cameras
- Integration with physical access control systems
- Mobile alerts and monitoring
- Comprehensive analytics dashboard

## Project Goals

The primary goals of the AI-Guard project are to:

1. **Enhance Security**: Prevent unauthorized access to campus facilities
2. **Optimize Resources**: Reduce the need for manual security monitoring
3. **Provide Insights**: Generate valuable data about access patterns and security events
4. **Demonstrate Innovation**: Showcase the application of AI in practical security solutions
5. **Create a Framework**: Develop a system that can be adapted for other educational institutions

## Why AI-Guard?

AI-Guard offers several advantages over traditional security systems:

- **Intelligence**: Goes beyond simple motion detection to actually identify individuals
- **Efficiency**: Automatically monitors entry points without requiring constant human attention
- **Scalability**: Can be expanded to cover multiple entry points and buildings
- **Adaptability**: Can be customized for different security requirements
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Provides advanced security capabilities at a fraction of the cost of employing additional security personnel

## Ethical Considerations

We take privacy and ethical concerns seriously in the development of AI-Guard:

- **Consent**: All enrolled individuals provide explicit consent for face data collection
- **Data Security**: Face embeddings are stored securely with encryption
- **Minimal Data**: Only the necessary data is stored to perform recognition
- **Transparency**: Clear documentation of how the system works and what data is collected
- **Bias Mitigation**: Efforts to ensure the system works fairly across different demographics
