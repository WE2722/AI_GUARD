# Project Team

The AI-Guard project was developed by a dedicated team from ENSAM Meknès. This page introduces the team members and their contributions to the project.

## Core Team

### Wiame El Hafid
**Project Lead**

Wiame led the AI-Guard project, overseeing both the technical and strategic aspects of the system's development. Her contributions include:

- Project conceptualization and overall architecture design
- Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques
- Model training and evaluation methodologies
- Documentation and presentation

Wiame's background in computer vision and machine learning provided the foundation for AI-Guard's recognition capabilities.

### Houssam Rjili
**ML Engineer & System Developer**

Houssam served as the technical lead for AI-Guard, focusing on the implementation of the system's core functionality. His contributions include:

- Face detection and recognition model implementation
- Multi-angle enrollment workflow development
- Integration of different components into a cohesive system
- Data processing pipeline development

Houssam's expertise in Python development and deep learning frameworks was instrumental in bringing the project's vision to reality.

## Project Advisors

The AI-Guard team received guidance and support from faculty advisors at ENSAM Meknès, who provided valuable insights and direction throughout the development process.

## Project History

AI-Guard began as a capstone project at ENSAM Meknès, addressing the growing security concerns in educational institutions. The project evolved through several stages:

1. **Research Phase**: Investigation of facial recognition technologies and security system requirements
2. **Proof of Concept**: Development of core recognition capabilities
3. **Prototype Stage**: Implementation of enrollment and alert workflows
4. **Current Stage**: Refinement and documentation for broader use

We continue to develop and improve AI-Guard, with plans to deploy it in real-world settings and expand its capabilities based on user feedback.
