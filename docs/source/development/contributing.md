- Show empathy towards other community members

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your development environment** following the [Development Setup Guide](setup.md).

2. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.

3. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-guard.git
   cd ai-guard
   ```

4. **Add the upstream remote** to keep your fork updated:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/ai-guard.git
   ```

5. **Create a new branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Check the roadmap** and [Issues](https://github.com/your-username/ai-guard/issues) to find something to work on.

2. **Keep your branch updated** with the upstream main branch:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

3. **Make your changes** in small, logical commits.

4. **Follow the [coding standards](#coding-standards)**.

5. **Run tests** to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.

6. **Update documentation** as needed.

7. **Create a pull request** when your changes are ready for review.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch** with the latest changes from the upstream main branch.

2. **Run all tests** to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.

3. **Push your changes** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Create a pull request** from your branch to the upstream main branch.

5. **Fill out the pull request template** with a clear description of your changes.

6. **Address review feedback** and make necessary changes.

7. **Your pull request will be merged** once it meets all requirements and passes review.

```

## Coding Standards

We follow strict coding standards to maintain code quality and consistency:

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) formatter with default settings
- Sort imports with [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)
- Follow [Google's docstring style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
- Use type hints according to [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)

### Code Quality Tools

Before submitting a pull request, run these tools on your code:

```bash
# Format code with Black
black ai_guard tests

# Sort imports
isort ai_guard tests

# Check code quality with flake8
flake8 ai_guard tests

# Run type checking
mypy ai_guard
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Variables and functions**: Use `snake_case`
- **Classes**: Use `PascalCase`
- **Constants**: Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Private methods/variables**: Prefix with underscore (`_private_method`)
- **Module names**: Short, lowercase words (no underscores)

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line
- Consider using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format

### Example Commit Message

```
feat: Add multi-angle face verification

Implement verification using embeddings from multiple face angles.
This improves recognition accuracy in challenging conditions.

Closes #123
```

## Testing

All code contributions should include appropriate tests:

### Test Requirements

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure existing tests continue to pass
- Aim for high test coverage (at least 80%)
- Include both positive and negative test cases

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=ai_guard

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_detection.py
```

## Documentation

Documentation is a crucial part of the project:

### Code Documentation

- All modules, classes, and functions should have docstrings
- Complex algorithms should include explanatory comments
- Use inline comments sparingly and only for non-obvious code

### Project Documentation

- Update relevant documentation when adding or changing features
- Follow the existing documentation style and format
- Create new documentation pages as needed

### Example Docstring

```python
def compare_embeddings(embedding1, embedding2):
    """Compare two face embeddings using cosine similarity.
    
    Args:
        embedding1 (np.ndarray): First face embedding vector.
        embedding2 (np.ndarray): Second face embedding vector.
        
    Returns:
        float: Similarity score between 0 and 1, where higher values
              indicate greater similarity.
              
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the embeddings have different dimensions.
    """
```

## Issue Reporting

If you find a bug or have a suggestion:

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates.

2. **Create a new issue** using the appropriate template.

3. **Provide detailed information** including:
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Screenshots or logs if applicable
   - System information (OS, Python version, etc.)

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome:

1. **Check the roadmap** to see if your feature is already planned.

2. **Create a new issue** using the feature request template.

3. **Describe the feature** in detail, including:
   - Problem it solves
   - Proposed solution
   - Alternatives considered
   - Potential implementation approach

## Communication

Clear communication is essential for collaboration:

### Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports, feature requests, and task tracking
- **Pull Requests**: For code reviews and feature discussions
- **Documentation**: For long-term knowledge sharing

### Guidelines

- Be clear and concise in your communications
- Provide context and background information
- Ask questions when uncertain â€” itâ€™s better to ask than assume
- Respect differing time zones and availability; contributors may respond asynchronously
